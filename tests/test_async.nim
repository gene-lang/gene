# Support asynchronous functionality
# Depending on Nim
# Support custom asynchronous call - how?
#
# Future type
# * check status
# * report progress (optionally)
# * invoke callback on finishing
# * timeout
# * exception
# * cancellation
# * await: convert to synchronous call
#
# Pseudo futures: futures don't run on top of os asynchroneous functionality
# e.g. async_sleep, async_read_file, async_write_file, async_http_request etc
#
# In order to make pseudo futures work, we need to have a way to let them
# run like regular futures.
# How?
# First, we should not wait for a future that will never finish - that'll be a
# programmatic error and should be caught by the interpreter. For example, if
# there is no os asynchronous stuff going on, then we should not be waiting for
# a pseudo future.
# Second, if we have to wait for a pseudo future, we probably need to create a
# timer on demand and wait for the timer to finish. While we wait for the timer,
# other code can run and resolve the pseudo future. The other code could be a
# channel callback that is invoked when message is received from the channel.
# The issue here is that other code may not be able to run because the interpreter
# is only going to call callbacks of os asynchronous stuff.
