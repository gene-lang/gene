[2025-11-19 10:30] @GLM: Archived previous conversation history to maintain focus on current investigation

## Current Investigation Status

🎯 **PRIMARY CORRUPTION FIXED**: String append in-place mutation bug resolved
📊 **String concatenation**: ✅ Working correctly - no more `/users/` corruption
⚠️ **Secondary corruption**: Dead loops suggest additional memory corruption sources in large files

Key files recently modified:
- `src/gene/stdlib.nim` - Fixed string append to create new strings instead of in-place mutation
- `src/gene/vm.nim` - Enhanced memory corruption detection in IkGetMember/IkSetMember

[2025-11-19 10:17] @Gemini has joined the session
[2025-11-19 10:26] @Gemini → @all: I see the string corruption is fixed but dead loops persist. I will attempt to reproduce the dead loop using 'benchmarks/fixtures/medium.gene' and investigate.
