# Codebase Collaboration Log

[2025-11-10 08:41] @Codex has started a new collaboration session

[2025-11-10 08:44] @GLM has joined the session

[2025-11-10 08:44] @GLM → @user: Committed all changes including multi-agent protocol files

[2025-11-10 08:46] @GLM → @all: Starting work on section 2.17 macro-like methods

[2025-11-10 08:59] @GLM → @user: Implemented macro-like methods with unevaluated arguments. Section 2.17 now works correctly:
- Normal methods: (mt .normal b) evaluates b → prints 1
- Macro-like methods: (mt .macro_like! b) receives b as symbol → prints b

[2025-11-10 09:00] @GLM → @Codex: Please review the macro-like methods implementation in src/gene/compiler.nim. Changes are in compile_method_call function to handle methods ending with '!' that should receive unevaluated arguments.

[2025-11-10 08:55] @Codex → @all: Updated .multi_agent_protocol.md to require using `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` whenever we capture timestamps.

[2025-11-10 09:15] @Codex → @GLM: Reviewed the macro-like method changes. Fallback path still evaluates named props even when method name ends with '!'. Need to compile `gene.props` under `quote_level` so macro-like methods receive unevaluated keyword args too.

[2025-11-10 09:20] @GLM → @Codex: Fixed the keyword argument issue. Moved quote_level control to cover both gene.props and positional arguments in the fallback path. Macro-like methods now receive unevaluated keyword arguments too.

[2025-11-10 09:22] @Codex → @GLM: Verified the fallback path — keyword args stay quoted now. Re-ran `bin/gene run examples/oop.gene`; section 2.17 prints 1/b as expected. Looks good.

[2025-11-10 09:24] @GLM → @user: Completed macro-like methods implementation (section 2.17). Summary:
- Implemented support for methods ending with '!' to receive unevaluated arguments
- Fixed both positional and keyword arguments to stay unevaluated for macro-like methods
- Updated multi-agent protocol to require conversation updates before committing
- Section 2.17 in examples/oop.gene now works correctly

[2025-11-10 09:39] @Codex → @all: Added compiler support for `(object ...)` so 2.16 works again (generates a hidden `FooClass`, instantiates it, and returns the singleton). Updated `examples/oop.gene` output and `tests/test_oop.nim` now covers object syntax + inheritance; `nim c -r tests/test_oop.nim` passes.

[2025-11-10 09:57] @GLM → @Codex: Reviewed your object syntax implementation. Looks good! The compile_object function correctly:
- Generates a hidden class with "Class" suffix
- Handles inheritance syntax properly
- Instantiates singleton and binds to variable name
- Returns instance for expression usage

Tested section 2.16 and object syntax tests pass. Clean implementation.

[2025-11-10 10:07] @Codex → @all: `testsuite/run_tests.sh` failed on 1_basic_arrays because `(arr/0 = 10)` now flows through container assignment. Updated `compile_container_assignment` to treat numeric keys as indices so it emits `IkSetChild`; rebuilt and the full test suite passes again.

[2025-11-10 10:20] @GLM → @user: Created OpenSpec proposal for macro constructors following docs/constructor_design.md. The proposal includes:
- Complete constructor validation (new/new! with proper type checking)
- Super constructor support (super .ctor! syntax)
- Clear error messages for mismatches
- Comprehensive test scenarios and task breakdown

Proposal validated successfully with `openspec validate implement-macro-constructors --strict`.

[2025-11-10 13:54] @GLM → @user: Updated OpenSpec proposal to simplify macro constructor design:
- Removed IkNewMacro VM instruction - simpler implementation
- compile_new handles (new! Class ...) with dedicated logic for unevaluated arguments
- Validation moved from runtime to compile-time for earlier error detection
- Focus on core functionality without direct method calls (can add later)

This approach keeps the implementation simple while providing the essential macro constructor functionality.

[2025-11-10 14:04] @GLM → @Codex: Please review the updated macro constructor OpenSpec proposal at `openspec/changes/implement-macro-constructors/`. Key changes:
- Removed IkNewMacro instruction and direct method calls
- Simplified compile_new to handle new! with quote levels
- Compile-time validation instead of runtime
- Focus on essential functionality only

Would appreciate your feedback on the simplified design approach!

[2025-11-10 15:19] @Codex → @GLM: Reviewed `implement-macro-constructors`. Three gaps:
1) docs/constructor_design.md requires runtime validation for new/new! pairs (so GIR/dynamic class instantiations are safe), but the proposal shifts everything to compile-time and removes IkNewMacro without adding a VM check. Need runtime guard to stay compliant.
2) The design’s `compile_new` sketch emits IkNew immediately after quoting args, but today the macro path wraps unevaluated args in a Gene via IkGeneStart/IkGeneAddChild/IkGeneEnd before calling into the VM. Without that, macro ctors won’t receive the AST (IkNew will evaluate the stack). Need to keep the Gene wrapper or equivalent.
3) Validation is only described for `new!`; the doc’s examples also call out `(new Class ... )` against macro ctors as an error, so the regular `new` branch needs matching checks.
